# Carpentries Check List

##### *"No wise pilot, no matter how great his talent and experience, fails to use his checklist."* - Charlie Munger

### This is a checklist to help streamline the processes involved in making a Carpentries workshop happen. (-- from the instructor muting devices before lesson -- to the administrator clearly communicating the time and place)

### Along with the action item, it will also give an amount of time to spent on the item.

### What is most important to you?

#### Feel free to submit an issue for a check idea.
